Project Overview
This project uses the following tech stack:

Next.js - React framework for server-side rendering and building web applications
SQLite - SQL database for storing application data
Prisma - ORM for interacting with the SQLite database
NextAuth - Authentication for Next.js using credentials provider
Setting Up the Project
Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/khulalit/Calculator-with-login-save-feature
Install dependencies: npm install

Setup database: npx prisma migrate dev --name init
Create .env file with database URL: DATABASE_URL="file:../calculatordb.db"
Run development server: npm run dev
The app will be running at http://localhost:3000

Database Schema
The SQLite database has the following schema managed by Prisma:

Users table - Stores user accounts
Calculation table - Stores calculation
The schema is defined in prisma/schema.prisma and can be updated using prisma migrate.

NextAuth Credentials Provider
Authentication is handled by NextAuth.js using the Credentials Provider.

Users sign in with email and password which are verified against the Users table in the database.

Authentication state and tokens are managed by NextAuth automatically.
